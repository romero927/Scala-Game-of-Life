# Game of Life
A simple Scala implementation of Conway's Game of Life with a ScalaFX (JavaFX) UI.

As of April 2020, updated to use the most recent ScalaFX release and Java 13.

A JEnv `.java-versions` file is included in the root of the project to locally set this project to use Java 13 (for those with both JEnv _and_ Java 13 installed).
